 You got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know theres a spunk-water stump, and just as its midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say:

Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,

and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody
