 Im thankful to the good God and Father of us all Ive got you back, thats long-suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness knows Im unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places, theres few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes
